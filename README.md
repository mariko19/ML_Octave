# ML using Octave
This repository includes the implementation of ML algorithms using Octave (the Standford Machine Learning online course).

## Project overview
In this project, I am tasked with completing 8 programming assignments ("task", for short). 
Each task folder represents the ML algorithm implementation. A .pdf file included in each task provides a detailed description on how it's implemented.
