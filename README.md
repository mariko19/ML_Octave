# ML using Octave
This repository includes the implementation of ML algorithms using Octave.

## Project overview
In this project, I am tasked with completing 8 programming assignments ("task", for short) to pass the Standford Machine Learning online course. 
Each task folder represents the ML algorithm implementation. A .pdf file included in each task provides a detailed description on how it's implemented.
