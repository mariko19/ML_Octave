# ML_Octave
Projects using Octave (the Standford Machine Learning online course)

This folder includes 8 programming assignments ("task", for short) I've successfully completed online. 
Each task folder represents the ML algorithm implementation. A .pdf file included in each task gives clear description on how it's implemented.
